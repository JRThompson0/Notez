# Chapter 9: Life and Death of an Object
- An object is created in the heap, where it lives. 
	* a reference must be created in the stack for the object to be used.
- An object has references to other objects and primitive data types stored within.
- An object must be constructed before it can be referenced.
- You can make multiple different constructors for the same object, taking different types of variables in order to complete the construction, as well as to tell the computer what constructor you want to use.
