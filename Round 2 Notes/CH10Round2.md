# Chapter 10: 
- Static methods cannot be called by instance variables, and do not *need* instance variables. 
- Instance methods cannot be called without an instance of the object, which means they cannot be called from a static method.
- Static variables are shared between all members of the class.
- Primitive types can't be used in most object collection types without a special method-a wrapper is needed to hold the object in a way the compiler can understand as part of a collection and unpack/use it as needed.
- Java date is deprecated. Use Java calendar.
- Formatting strings and numbers is wack.
