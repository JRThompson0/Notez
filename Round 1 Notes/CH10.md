### Static Methods vs Non-Static Methods
+ Static method: Math is the best example. You call it from other methods more than anything else. There is no such thing as a math object, and Math is always in the background when the program that called it is running. 
+ Non-static methods: Everything else. Cannot be called from static methods. Static methods can be called from non-static methods.
### Wrappers:

+ primitive types cannot be put into arraylists or other Object-specific collections, they gotta get wrapped.
  + int &rarr; Integer
  + char &rarr; Character
  + boolean &rarr; Boolean

+ These objects have methods like toString() as well. 
+ Autoboxing does the work for you sometimes.
