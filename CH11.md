### Error Handling
+ Error handling goes as follows:
  + Try (a Risky method that declared it can throw errors),
  + Catch(one of those declared errors and follow instructions on what to do in the event of those errors)
  + Finally(Do things afterwards that must happen regardless of success or faliure.)
+ Multiple error types means multiple catches.
+ Catches are polymorphic, meaning you could theoretically take every single error type and use the exact same catch code for it. 
  + Don't do that tho.
  + Catches let you recover from errors entirely if those catches are more specific.
+ Multiple catch blocks must be ordered smallest to biggest.


One way to catch an error is to declare that your own method can throw that error. It doesn't do anything about the error, but it will let you use the risky method without the compiler freaking out. 

Any method that calls your now-risky method will have to catch the errors you now declared you throw, or otherwise declare that it can throw those errors no method has dealt with at this point.
